Code Review and Task List for OpenAI Chat Parser Tool
=====================================================

We have made significant progress on the development of the **OpenAI Chat Parser** tool. In this log entry, we will review the current state of the code and outline the remaining tasks using Sphinx todo directives.

Code Review
-----------

The current version of the OpenAI Chat Parser script:

1. Reads configuration settings from a `config.json` file, allowing users to customize destination folders, download retries, and other settings.
2. Provides a `download_zip` function to download conversation archives from a given URL.
3. Implements an `unzip_and_parse_conversations` function to extract and parse the conversations from the downloaded ZIP file.
4. Offers a `parse_conversation` function to save conversation contents into separate files, including message text and code blocks.
5. Presents a `main` function that prompts the user for the ZIP URL, downloads the archive, and processes the conversations.

.. todo::

   - Add error handling and input validation to improve the robustness of the script.
   - Implement unit tests for the various functions to ensure correctness and reliability.
   - Improve documentation, including comments and function docstrings, for better maintainability and understanding of the code.

Task List
---------

.. todo:: Add error handling and input validation to the script.

   This task will involve adding try-except blocks and input validation checks to ensure the script can handle unexpected situations and user errors.

.. todo:: Implement unit tests for the various functions.

   Writing unit tests will help verify the functionality of the individual components of the script and identify potential issues early in the development process.

.. todo:: Improve documentation, including comments and function docstrings.

   Enhancing the documentation will make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand for future developers and users.
