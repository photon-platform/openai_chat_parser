We are excited to introduce our latest tool: **OpenAI Chat Parser**. This Python script is designed to download, extract, and parse OpenAI chat conversation archives, allowing users to easily organize and manage their chat transcripts.

Use Cases and Examples
----------------------

1. Researchers and developers working with OpenAI chat models can utilize this tool to better understand and analyze the generated conversations.

2. Users interested in maintaining a well-organized archive of their OpenAI chat history can use this tool to save conversations in a more accessible format.

3. Project managers and team leads can store and review the history of AI-assisted conversations, ensuring that discussions are on track and relevant.

Features
--------

1. **Download and Extract**: The tool automatically downloads conversation archive ZIP files from a given URL and extracts the contents, preparing them for parsing.

2. **Parse Conversations**: OpenAI Chat Parser processes the conversations, organizing them into separate folders with appropriate file formats based on the conversation content.

3. **Code Block Extraction**: The tool is capable of extracting code blocks from conversations, saving them as separate files with the correct file extensions.

4. **Flexible Configuration**: Users can customize settings, such as destination folders and download retries, by editing the `config.json` file.

5. **CLI Support**: The script can be executed from the command line, making it easy to integrate into various workflows.

Getting Started
---------------

To start using the OpenAI Chat Parser tool, simply download the script, adjust the `config.json` file to your preferences, and run it from the command line. The tool will then prompt you for the ZIP URL containing your conversation archive, and it will take care of the rest.
